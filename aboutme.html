                My name is Kunal Patadia and I was born in Riverside,CA.
                I've lived here <br />most of my life and have always been fond
                with creativity. Whether if it's<br />through problem solving
                or making something from scratch it has always<br /> attracted me.

                <b><u>BACKGROUND:</u></b> I graduated in 2015 with a BA in Philosophy. I initially decided<br />
                I wanted to go to law school, but quickly realized it wasn't something I had a<br />
                passion for. I spent a couple years trying to pursue film until I realized I wanted<br />
                to do something more. I was introduced to programming and immediately<br />
                felt intimidation and love, a very odd mix. However, I persisted and ended up<br />
                pursuing my second bachelors degree in Computer Science at Oregon State<br /> University.

                <b><u>INTERESTS:</u></b> Asides from programming, I love to travel, film, and photography.<br />
                I've travelled to 9 countries including Canada, India, Tanzania, United Arab Emirates,<br />
                Spain, Greece, Turkey, Mexico, and Great Britain. My favorite show is

                <b><u>PROJECTS:</u></b> Here are a couple of projects I've worked on.
                <span style="color:#E3C011;">NextWord</span>
                was<br /> created in C++ and is a word guessing game where two players must compete to<br />
                guess more correct words than their opponent.
                <span style="color:#E3C011;">Skyrim: Ruins of Alftand</span> is a<br /> terminal text game created for
                a class project. It was also written in C++ and was<br /> picked as one of the best class projects.
