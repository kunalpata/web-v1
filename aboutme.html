                I was born in Riverside,CA and have always been fond
                of creativity. Whether if<br /> it's through problem solving
                or making something from scratch it has always<br /> attracted me.

                <b><u>BACKGROUND:</u></b> I graduated in 2015 with a BA in Philosophy. Initially deciding<br />
                to go to law school, but instantly came to a realization it wasn't something I had<br /> a
                passion for. Spent a couple years trying to pursue film until I realized I wanted<br />
                to do something more. Shortly after programming was brought into in my life<br /> and there was
                immediate intimidation and love for it, a very odd mix. However,<br /> I persisted and ended up
                pursuing my second bachelors degree in Computer<br /> Science at Oregon State University.

                <span style="color:#E3C011;">NextWord</span>
                was<br /> created in C++ and is a word guessing game where two players must compete to<br />
                guess more correct words than their opponent.
                <span style="color:#E3C011;">Skyrim: Ruins of Alftand</span> is a<br /> terminal text game created for
                a class project. It was also written in C++ and was<br /> picked as one of the best class projects.
